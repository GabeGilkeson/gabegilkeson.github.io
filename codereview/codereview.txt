Code Review for Titus Taylor’s Calculator.java
Reviewed by: Gabriel Gilkeson

Things I liked:
Line 14 – Using .trim() is a good way to clean up the user input.
Line 86 – I liked that you used error messages to explain exactly what went wrong.

Suggestion:
Line 86: You used double for numbers even though decimals aren’t allowed.
Maybe using long instead could would avoid unnesesary checks for decimal values.

Reflection:
Reviewing this code helped me understand how calculators can use stacks to follow order of operations.
It was a little confusing at first, but the way the code separates numbers and operators made it easier to follow.
I also learned how useful comments can be.
